                        <hr class="solidBorder">
                        <p>
                            During my senior year of high school I was trying to earn my Eagle Scout Rank. One 
                            of its biggest challenges is the Eagle Scout Project. I had to plan, develop, and 
                            execute a community service project that makes a lasting difference. I started my 
                            search at my home parish to see what I could improve. What i noticed was the social 
                            hall & gradeschool gym area was about to be remoddled but there was a lot of prep work 
                            that needed to be done. At this point in time the parish couldn't remodel the area 
                            because they don't have the funds to hire movers to clear our 50 years worth of clutter 
                            and storage, and also parish volunteers were getting really old so they couldn't be 
                            much help. I decided that was going to be my project: to set up the social hall & gym 
                            for remodel thus saving my parish a lot of time and money. My scout troop and I 
                            reclocated the parish office, reorganized the garage, cleaned out the stage & storage 
                            area, and saved everything that needed to be saved in temporary storage. 2 days later 
                            my project was complete and I was one step closer to earning my Eagle Scout Rank.

                            During the summer of 2022 I had the opportunity of interning at M Health Fairview as 
                            a network engineer. Over the course of my internship, I learned about fairview's network 
                            architecture & its fiber circuits. I leanred how to calibrate & monitor network switches, 
                            uninterupptible power supplies (UPS) and automatic transfer switches (ATS). I got to work 
                            in the data centers and upgrade the servers as well as all of the network closets in the 
                            7 major hospitals. Most of all I got to eat some really good food. Fairview spares no 
                            expense when it comes to feeding its employees, faculty, & patients with a wonderful and 
                            wide variety of professionally cooked meals. Press the logo to learn more.

                            At the end of this summer I recieved an internship offer at Infinite Campus. I started 
                            at the beginning of September and currently I work part time throughout the school year. 
                            At work I am developing an app that can search the internal databases and return certain 
                            columns and properties. Since then I have put my SQL knowledge to good use and I am 
                            learning how to use both Javascript and SpringBoot to build RESTful applications. At work 
                            they have a koi pond and a climbing wall so it allows the employees to relax and stay 
                            active from all the screen fatigue. As of 9/30/22, the company just celebreated our 25th 
                            anniversary! All of us stood on the back lawn and we took a photo using a drone. Press the 
                            logo to learn more about the company.
