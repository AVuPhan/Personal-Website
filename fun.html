                        <p>
                            College has been the most impactful experiences in my life. The most noteable thing was 
                            finding an amazing circle of people I trust and love to have fun with. All of my roommates 
                            are awesome. I love hanging out with them. Of the people in our house, I am the only one 
                            from Minnesota, and they are all from Green Bay. There is always that one sunday where 
                            the vikings play against the packers and that is the one day of the year we do not get 
                            along. Otherwise, we have made so many memories together and will make many more as 
                            the year goes on!
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Outside of my friends, I have a whole group of brothers I also love hanging out with. I am 
                            a part of Sigma Chi, the only social fraternity here on campus. Those guys are ambitious 
                            students, possessed of good morals, are honorable, and are responsible, and are men of good 
                            character. And I am proud to be among them. This past spring we had our formal here on campus 
                            and it was a whole lot of fun. Over the summer we hung out together on the lake, trying to 
                            escape the chaos of our daily lives. Recently we started going to soccer games together and 
                            it has been a lot of fun cheering for the Minnesota Loons.

                        <hr class="solidBorder">
                        <p>
                            Merriam Webster defines 'foodie' as a 'person having an avid interest in a wide variety as well 
                            as the latest food fads.' I would consider myself to be a foodie because I love trying new food 
                            and I love to eat in general. Since living on my own, I've been experimenting with new recipies 
                            as well as trying all the restaurants around the twin cities. There are so many options and I am 
                            working my way through them all slowly but surely. As we all know, 'diet & excersise are a happy 
                            couple' so I try to hit the gym at least once a week to burn off all the calories I have stored 
                            up in my gut. My all time favorite food is Birria Tacos (pictured bottom center). The taco meat 
                            is slow cooked in a vegetable broth. Creamy cheese, garnishes, and shredded taco meat are placed 
                            on a crispy corn tortilla that has been fried in the broth. Then, when you eat it you dunk the 
                            taco in the broth for extra flavor. I always encourage everyone to try it because it will send 
                            your tastebuds to heaven.

                        <p>
                            My parents grew up in a culture where pets aren't a normal thing. Sure, they had dogs in Vietnam 
                            but they were kept as yard pets. When they came to America they were suprised that people keep 
                            dogs in the house and also let them sleep in bed with them! I love dogs because they bring perPETual 
                            happiness so I am adopting a puppy as a graduation gift to myself. Pictured bottom right is my 
                            roommate's golden retriever. His name is Rudy and he is the goodest of good boys and I love it when 
                            his parents bring him to visit. Outside of dogs, I have a koi pond in my backyard at home. The man 
                            who sold our current house to my family was a viietnam vet & he built a japanese style garden in the 
                            backyard to kelp with his PTSD. He recovered very well so him and his wife moved somewhere warmer. 
                            Luckily he asked us if we wanted to keep the garden before he moved so we said yes. I have 12 koi 
                            and several koi fry in the pond. They love human attention and will swim toward you if they sense 
                            your presence. They are very majestic and I love to hangout by the pond with them.
